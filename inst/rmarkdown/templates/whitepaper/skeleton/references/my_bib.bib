	abstract = {Objectives
To examine the relationship between non-fatal overdose and risk of subsequent fatal overdose.
Methods
We assessed risk factors for overdose death among two prospective cohorts of persons who inject drugs (PWID) in Vancouver, Canada. Extended Cox regression was used to examine if reports of non-fatal overdose were associated with the time to fatal overdose while adjusting for other behavioral, social and structural confounders.
Results
Between May, 1996 and December, 2011, 2317 individuals were followed for a median of 60.8 months. In total, 134 fatal overdose deaths were identified for an incidence density of 8.94 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 7.55–10.59) deaths per 1000 person-years. During the study period there were 1795 reports of non-fatal overdose. In a multivariate model, recent non-fatal overdose was independently associated with the time to overdose mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR]=1.95; 95\% CI: 1.17–3.27). As well, there was a dose response effect of increasing cumulative reports of non-fatal overdose on subsequent fatal overdose.
Conclusion
Reports of recent non-fatal overdose were independently associated with subsequent overdose mortality in a dose-response relationship. These findings suggest that individuals reporting recent non-fatal overdose should be engaged with intensive overdose prevention interventions.},

	abstract = {Methods: This retrospective cohort study linked Maryland statewide ED hospital claims records for adults with nonfatal overdose or substance use disorder encounters in 2014 to 2015 with medical examiner mortality records in 2015 to 2016. Logistic regression was used to identify factors in hospital records associated with risk of opioid overdose death. Predicted probabilities for overdose death were calculated for hypothetical patients with different combinations of overdose and substance use diagnostic histories.
Results: A total of 139,252 patients had substance-related ED encounters in 2014 to 2015. Of these patients, 963 later experienced an opioid overdose death, indicating a case fatality rate of 69.2 per 10,000 patients, 6 times higher than that of patients who used the ED for any cause. Factors most strongly associated with death included having both an opioid and another substance use disorder (adjusted odds ratio 2.88; 95\% conﬁdence interval 2.04 to 4.07), having greater than or equal to 3 previous nonfatal overdoses (adjusted odds ratio 2.89; 95\% conﬁdence interval 1.54 to 5.43), and having a previous nonfatal overdose involving heroin (adjusted odds ratio 2.24; 95\% conﬁdence interval 1.64 to 3.05).
Conclusion: These results highlight important differences in overdose risk among patients receiving care in EDs for substancerelated conditions. The ﬁndings demonstrate the potential utility of incorporating routine data from patient records to assess risk of future negative outcomes and identify primary targets for initiation and linkage to lifesaving care.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In response to some of the highest drug overdose death rates in the country, Project Lazarus developed a community-based overdose prevention program in Western North Carolina. The Wilkes County unintentional poisoning mortality rate was quadruple that of the state's in 2009 and due almost exclusively to prescription opioid pain relievers, including fentanyl, hydrocodone, methadone, and oxycodone. The program is ongoing.
METHODS: The overdose prevention program involves five components: community activation and coalition building; monitoring and surveillance data; prevention of overdoses; use of rescue medication for reversing overdoses by community members; and evaluating project components. Principal efforts include education of primary care providers in managing chronic pain and safe opioid prescribing, largely through the creation of a tool kit and face-to-face meetings.
RESULTS: Preliminary unadjusted data for Wilkes County revealed that the overdose death rate dropped from 46.6 per 100,000 in 2009 to 29.0 per 100,000 in 2010. There was a decrease in the number of victims who received prescriptions for the substance implicated in their fatal overdose from a Wilkes County physician; in 2008, 82\% of overdose decedents received a prescription for an opioid analgesic from a Wilkes prescriber compared with 10\% in 2010.
CONCLUSIONS: While the results from this community-based program are preliminary, the number and nature of prescription opioid overdose deaths in Wilkes County changed during the intervention. Further evaluation is required to understand the localized effect of the intervention and its potential for replication in other areas.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The objective was to evaluate the effects of Project Alcohol and Substance Abuse Services Education and Referral to Treatment (ASSERT), an emergency department (ED)-based screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment program for unhealthy alcohol and other drug use.
METHODS: Health promotion advocates (HPAs) screened ED patients for alcohol and/or drug problems 7 days a week using questions embedded in a general health questionnaire. Patients with unhealthy drinking and/or drug use received a brief negotiation interview (BNI), with the goal of reducing alcohol/drug use and/or accepting a referral to a specialized treatment facility (STF), depending on severity of use. Patients referred to an STF were followed up at 1 month by phone or contact with the STF to determine referral completion and enrollment into the treatment program.
RESULTS: Over a 5-year period (December 1999 through December 2004), 22,534 adult ED patients were screened. A total of 10,246 (45.5\%) reported alcohol consumption in the past 30 days, of whom 5,533 (54\%) exceeded the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) guidelines for low-risk drinking. Use of at least one illicit drug was reported by 3,530 patients (15.7\%). Over one-fourth of screened patients received BNIs (6,266, or 27.8\%). Of these, 3,968 (63\%) were referred to an STF. Eighty-three percent of patients were followed at 1 month, and 2,159 (65\%) had enrolled in a program. Patients who received a direct admission to an STF were 30 times more likely to enroll than those who were indirectly referred (odds ratio = 30.71; 95\% confidence interval = 18.48 to 51.04). After 3 years, funding for Project ASSERT was fully incorporated into the ED budget.
CONCLUSIONS: Project ASSERT has been successfully integrated into an urban ED. A direct, facilitated referral for patients with alcohol and other drug problems results in a high rate of enrollment in treatment programs.},

	abstract = {The crisis in opioid overdose deaths has reached epidemic proportions in the United States and currently (33 091 in 2015) exceeds all other drug-related deaths. The risk for overdose resides primarily among those harboring a medical diagnosis of an opioid use disorder. Prescription opioids remain a primary driver of opioid-related fatalities. It is incumbent on the medical community to prevent, diagnose, and facilitate treatment of this disease and its substantial health consequences.From 1999 onwards, overdose deaths due to prescription opioids rose incrementally and consistently outpaced annual heroin death rates. Heroin overdose deaths remained relatively low from 1999 onwards and then escalated 3-fold from 2010 to 2015. These lamentable, premature, and preventable deaths persisted during 2014-2015, but surveys revealed a disproportionate rise in deaths attributable to fentanyl/analogs (72.2\%) and heroin (20.6\%) compared with prescription opioids (2.6\%). In this issue of JAMA Psychiatry, Martins et al portray a detailed view of heroin use trends over time by excavating data from the 2001-2002 and 2012-2013 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions and National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions–III. Although absolute values may be inexact because of different survey procedures in the 2 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions waves, or because homeless and incarcerated populations were not surveyed, the trends can assist in guiding targeted prevention and treatment services. The prevalence of heroin use increased 5-fold and use disorder tripled in the United States during the period of the 2 surveys. The rise was greater among white individuals, unmarried respondents, males, young users, those with lower educational achievement, and those living in poverty. Prior exposure to nonmedical prescription opioids increased among white heroin users, reinforcing concerns and other reports that prescription opioid misusers were transitioning to heroin use.},

Supervised injection of diacetylmorphine (the active ingredient in heroin) and flexible doses of methadone hydrochloride had been previously evaluated compared with oral methadone treatment for those who had failed methadone maintenance. These studies found that supervised diacetylmorphine injection was effective in improving retention in treatment and reducing illicit drug use, incarceration, and criminal offenses. Because diacetylmorphine is not available in most countries, the study by Oviedo-Joekes et al sought to determine whether supervised injection of hydromorphone could provide an alternative to diacetylmorphine. The study results indicate that for an important, but small and carefully defined population, supervised injection of hydromorphone has comparable efficacy to supervised heroin injection when both are provided in structured, well-staffed medical programs.},

	abstract = {A promise of machine learning in health care is the avoidance of biases in diagnosis and treatment; a computer algorithm could objectively synthesize and interpret the data in the medical record. Integration of machine learning with clinical decision support tools, such as computerized alerts or diagnostic support, may offer physicians and others who provide health care targeted and timely information that can improve clinical decisions. Machine learning algorithms, however, may also be subject to biases. The biases include those related to missing data and patients not identified by algorithms, sample size and underestimation, and misclassification and measurement error. There is concern that biases and deficiencies in the data used by machine learning algorithms may contribute to socioeconomic disparities in health care. This Special Communication outlines the potential biases that may be introduced into machine learning–based clinical decision support tools that use electronic health record data and proposes potential solutions to the problems of overreliance on automation, algorithms based on biased data, and algorithms that do not provide information that is clinically meaningful. Existing health care disparities should not be amplified by thoughtless or excessive reliance on machines.},

Netflix knows what movies people like to watch and Google knows what people want to know based on their search histories. Indeed, Google has recently begun to replace much of its existing non–machine learning technology with machine learning algorithms, and there is great optimism that these techniques can provide similar improvements across many sectors.It is no surprise then that medicine is awash with claims of revolution from the application of machine learning to big health care data. Recent examples have demonstrated that big data and machine learning can create algorithms that perform on par with human physicians. Though machine learning and big data may seem mysterious at first, they are in fact deeply related to traditional statistical models that are recognizable to most clinicians. It is our hope that elucidating these connections will demystify these techniques and provide a set of reasonable expectations for the role of machine learning and big data in health care.},

	abstract = {Background and objectives
Clinical staff providing addiction treatment predict patient outcome poorly. Prognoses based on linear statistics are rarely replicated. Addiction is a complex non-linear behavior. Incorporating non-linear models, Machine Learning (ML) has successfully predicted treatment outcome when applied in other areas of medicine. Using identical assessment data across the two groups, this study compares the accuracy of ML models versus clinical staff to predict alcohol dependence treatment outcome in behavior therapy using patient data only.
Methods
Machine learning models (n = 28) were constructed (‘trained’) using demographic and psychometric assessment data from 780 previously treated patients who had undertaken a 12 week, abstinence-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy program for alcohol dependence. Independent predictions applying assessment data for an additional 50 consecutive patients were obtained from 10 experienced addiction therapists and the 28 trained ML models. The predictive accuracy of the ML models and the addiction therapists was then compared with further investigation of the 10 best models selected by cross-validated accuracy on the training-set. Variables selected as important for prediction by staff and the most accurate ML model were examined.
Results
The most accurate ML model (Fuzzy Unordered Rule Induction Algorithm, 74\%) was significantly more accurate than the four least accurate clinical staff (51\%–40\%). However, the robustness of this finding may be limited by the moderate area under the receiver operator curve (AUC = 0.49). There was no significant difference in mean aggregate predictive accuracy between 10 clinical staff (56.1\%) and the 28 best models (58.57\%). Addiction therapists favoured demographic and consumption variables compared with the ML model using more questionnaire subscales.
Conclusions
The majority of staff and ML models were not more accurate than suggested by chance. However, the best performing prediction models may provide useful adjunctive information to standard clinically available prognostic data to more effectively target treatment approaches in clinical settings.},

	abstract = {Aims To examine how race and methamphetamine legislation are associated with changes in cocaine and methamphetamine use among untreated rural stimulant users. Design A longitudinal study of stimulant users identified through respondent-driven sampling. Setting Rural areas of three US states. Participants Participants at baseline were current users of methamphetamine and/or cocaine. Measures Self-reports of methamphetamine, crack cocaine and powder cocaine use were assessed at 6-month intervals over a 2-year period. Generalized estimating equations were performed to account for correlations between the repeated measurements. Findings Compared to whites, African Americans were much more likely to use crack cocaine, equally likely to use powder cocaine and much less likely to use methamphetamine. Both whites and African Americans reduced their consumption of methamphetamine and both forms of cocaine over 2 years. Exposure to laws restricting the purchase of over-the-counter cold medications containing methamphetamine precursors was not associated with methamphetamine use, but associated with a slight rise in powder and crack cocaine use. Conclusions The study yielded disconcerting as well as promising findings regarding the natural history of stimulant use in rural areas. Of some concern is that methamphetamine precursor laws were correlated with increased cocaine consumption, diminishing their net public health benefits. However, despite its insurgence in rural areas of the United States, very few African Americans have initiated methamphetamine use. Regardless of race, many stimulant users stopped using cocaine and methamphetamine without formal substance abuse treatment over 24 months.},

	abstract = {Aims Although crack cocaine first appeared in cities in the United States in the mid-1980s, little is known about its use over long periods of time. This study identified crack cocaine user groups on the basis of long-term trajectories. Design Following a natural history approach, data were collected periodically from 1996 to 2005. Group-based modeling assessed the probability of a crack smoker becoming abstinent during the observation period. Setting A targeted sampling plan guided the recruitment of a community sample of crack cocaine users in Dayton, Ohio. Participants Crack smokers (n = 430) 18 years or older whose urine tested positive for cocaine metabolites at the baseline interview. Measurements Interviewer-administered and audio computer self-administered, structured questionnaires were used to collect data on a range of variables, including frequency of crack use. Abstinence was defined as not having used crack for at least 6 consecutive months during the study. Findings Three trajectory-based groups were identified: (1) No Change, characterized by a very low probability of abstinence; (2) Some Change, characterized by a low to moderate probability of abstinence; and (3) Dramatic Change, characterized by a high probability of abstinence. African Americans and men were significantly less likely to become abstinent. For the majority of the people (63.6\%), crack use was uninterrupted by extended periods of abstinence during the study. Conclusion Crack cocaine use that persists for a decade or longer may well be the norm for a large proportion of people who have experience with the drug.},

Within the context of a broader effort, a community-based, non-arrest strategy directed at opioid addicts was developed, utilizing a motivational interviewing program intervention. The planned set of program interventions had two effects: first, more opioid addicts entered treatment as a result of the community engagement effort. Second, information gleaned from the ongoing dialogue with addicts helped accelerate several community-based efforts. These included opening a site for medication-assisted treatment and a newly formed collaboration between the police department and a local community service organization that expanded outreach to those who had been saved by naloxone treatment after an overdose. The BCJI program in Dayton reinforced the idea that crime reduction must be embedded in a community collaboration. The BCJI process enabled a shared policy and program space in which participants could bring their contacts, knowledge, and skills together. The final set of program innovations plied in Dayton exemplified the goals and aspirations of the BCJI program.},

Participants ranged in age from 21 to 57 years. The majority were White and male. The participants reported increases in methamphetamine availability and identified powder-type locally manufactured methamphetamine as the most commonly seen form of the drug. The participants reported extensive drug use histories, and were introduced to methamphetamine in the context of their involvement with pharmaceutical stimulants, crack, powder cocaine, and/or club drug scene. A large proportion of the participants continued to use crack or powder cocaine in addition to methamphetamine. Many primary methamphetamine users felt they were able to moderate methamphetamine use and fulfill their daily responsibilities related to work and family life. Ranking results and consensus analysis revealed that participants shared high agreement about drug-related risks, and perceived methamphetamine as a serious drug, although not as risky as heroin, crack or OxyContin®.

To explore this, we examined data from Ohio's Behavioral Health Juvenile Justice (BHJJ) Initiative, a diversion program for juvenile justice-involved youth with behavioral health issues. Three groups were examined, youth appropriate for BHJJ but who did not participate, youth who participated but did not complete treatment, and youth who successfully completed treatment. Results indicated youth who successfully completed BHJJ had lower odds of offending as young adults and fewer young adult offenses compared to youth who completed unsuccessfully or who did not participate.

ARCH's mission is to improve the health of citizens of Dayton through research involving community participation. Through ARCH, community members help researchers define priorities, resolve ethical issues, refine procedures, and interpret results. Guidelines for participatory research, proposed by the National Primary Care Research Group in 1998 and adopted by the alliance, emphasize the importance of open dialogue among researchers, subjects, academics, and community members.

	abstract = {Applications of estimating population sizes range from estimating human or ecological population size within regions or countries to estimating the hidden number of civilian casualties in war. Total enumeration via a census is typically infeasible. However, a series of partial enumerations of a population is often possible, leading to capture-recapture methods, which have been extensively used in ecology to estimate the size of wildlife populations with an associated measure of uncertainty and are most effectively applied when there are multiple capture occasions. Capture-recapture ideology can be more widely applied to multiple data sources by the linkage of individuals across multiple lists, often referred to as multiple systems estimation (MSE). The MSE approach is preferred when estimating capture-shy or hard-to-reach populations, including those who are caught up in the criminal justice system, trafficked, or civilian casualties of war. Motivated by the public policy applications of MSE, each briefly introduced, we discuss practical problems with methodological implications. They include period definition; case definition; scenarios when an observed count is not a true count of the population of interest but an upper bound due to mismatched definitions; exact or probabilistic matching of cases across lists; demographic or other information about the case that influences capture propensities; permissions to access lists; list creation by research teams or interested parties; referrals (if presence on list A results, almost surely, in presence on list B); different mathematical models leading to widely different estimated population sizes; uncertainty in estimation; computational efficiency; external validation; hypothesis generation; and additional independent external information. Returning to our motivational applications, we focus finally on whether the uncertainty that qualified their estimates was sufficiently narrow to orient public policy.},

	abstract = {Illicit drug use is an important public health problem with broad social costs. The low effectiveness of prevention efforts leaves treatment of drug dependence as one of the most powerful means of fighting illicit drug use. Treatment reduces drug use and crime and increases individuals' functioning. However, programs that treat drug dependence have high dropout rates and low completion rates. In addition, some individuals continue to use drugs while in treatment, and relapse is common. Furthermore, only a fraction of those who need treatment receive it. Recently, there have been important innovations that reduce barriers and increase effectiveness of treatment. These innovations include new pharmacological agents, novel counseling strategies, promising ways to motivate, and treatment in new settings. This paper describes standard treatments and recent innovations designed to increase (a) effectiveness of treatment, (b) motivation to seek care, (c) access, (d) retention, and (e) cost-effectiveness. We provide criteria on how these innovations should be evaluated in order to determine which should be adopted, funded, and transferred to existing and future treatment programs.},

	abstract = {Public health authorities have described, with growing alarm, an unprecedented increase in morbidity and mortality associated with use of opioid pain relievers (OPRs). Efforts to address the opioid crisis have focused mainly on reducing nonmedical OPR use. Too often overlooked, however, is the need for preventing and treating opioid addiction, which occurs in both medical and nonmedical OPR users. Overprescribing of OPRs has led to a sharp increase in the prevalence of opioid addiction, which in turn has been associated with a rise in overdose deaths and heroin use. A multifaceted public health approach that utilizes primary, secondary, and tertiary opioid addiction prevention strategies is required to effectively reduce opioid-related morbidity and mortality. We describe the scope of this public health crisis, its historical context, contributing factors, and lines of evidence indicating the role of addiction in exacerbating morbidity and mortality, and we provide a framework for interventions to address the epidemic of opioid addiction.},

Inpatient care began in 1935 with the US Public Health Service Hospitals in Lexington, Kentucky, and Fort Worth, Texas. Outpatient clinics emerged in the 1960s to provide aftercare. Research advances led to opioid agonist and opioid antagonist therapies. When patients complete opioid withdrawal, return to use is often rapid and frequently deadly. US and international authorities recommend opioid agonist therapy (i.e., methadone or buprenorphine). Opioid antagonist therapy (i.e., extended-release naltrexone) may also inhibit return to use. Prevention efforts emphasize public and prescriber education, use of prescription drug monitoring programs, and safe medication disposal options. Overdose education and naloxone distribution promote access to rescue medication and reduce opioid overdose fatalities. Opioid use disorder prevention and treatment must embrace evidence-based care and integrate with physical and mental health care.},

Risk factors for overdose, such as the type of drug consumed, and the route of administration, are known to differ across countries.

	abstract = {Background
Elements of the physical environment have been shown to influence health behaviors including drug use and overdose mortality. Throughout the opioid epidemic in the United States, rural regions have been disproportionately affected by opioid overdose. Although the relationship between the urban built environment and opioid overdose has been established, little is known as to how trends may differ in rural areas.
Methods
Risk terrain modeling was used as a spatial analytical approach to assess environmental features that significantly increase the risk of opioid overdose in Jefferson County, Alabama. Spatial risk assessments were conducted for urban and rural regions as well as for the county as a whole. Criminogenic, opioid-related, and community variables were included and compared across spatial risk models.
Results
The geographic context, rural or urban, influenced the relationship between environmental features and opioid overdose. In rural areas, community features such as bus stops and public schools were related to the occurrence of opioid overdose. In urban areas, inpatient treatment centers, transitional living facilities, express loan establishments, and liquor vendors were significantly related to the locations of opioid overdose.
Conclusion
Risk terrain modeling can be used to locate high-risk areas for opioid overdose while identifying factors that are contributing to the risk of events occurring in communities. The patterns of overdose risk differ in rural and urban contexts and may be used to inform the placement of treatment and prevention resources.},

	abstract = {Background
Law enforcement is often the first to respond to medical emergencies in the community, including overdose. Due to the nature of their job, officers have also witnessed first-hand the changing demographic of drug users and devastating effects on their community associated with the epidemic of nonmedical prescription opioid use in the United States. Despite this seminal role, little data exist on law enforcement attitudes toward overdose prevention and response.
Methods
We conducted key informant interviews as part of a 12-week Rapid Assessment and Response (RAR) process that aimed to better understand and prevent nonmedical prescription opioid use and overdose deaths in locations in Connecticut and Rhode Island experiencing overdose “outbreaks.” Interviews with 13 law enforcement officials across three study sites were analyzed to uncover themes on overdose prevention and naloxone.
Results
Findings indicated support for law enforcement involvement in overdose prevention. Hesitancy around naloxone administration by laypersons was evident. Interview themes highlighted officers’ feelings of futility and frustration with their current overdose response options, the lack of accessible local drug treatment, the cycle of addiction, and the pervasiveness of easily accessible prescription opioid medications in their communities. Overdose prevention and response, which for some officers included law enforcement-administered naloxone, were viewed as components of community policing and good police-community relations.
Conclusion
Emerging trends, such as existing law enforcement medical interventions and Good Samaritan Laws, suggest the need for broader law enforcement engagement around this pressing public health crisis, even in suburban and small town locations, to promote public safety.},

In many underserved locales, limited access to clinicians trained in addiction medicine and behavioral health exacerbates this disparity.

	abstract = {Objective
To explore and describe the structure and design elements of addiction medicine consult (AMC) services within selected U.S. hospitals.

Methods
As part of a larger mixed methods study, 10 qualitative semi-structured telephone interviews were completed with board-certified addiction medicine physicians affiliated with the Addiction Medicine Foundation’s Addiction Medicine Fellowship Programs at 9 U.S. hospitals. Interviews were transcribed, coded, and analyzed using a directed content analysis.

Results
Interviews completed with established AMC services in nine hospitals probed AMC structure and design commonalities and differences across four domains: 1) availability and coverage, 2) team composition, 3) scope and responsibility, and 4) financing. Only one service provided weekend consults and most services did not provide coverage in the emergency department. Interprofessional teams were common with a variety of discipline combinations. AMC service scope and responsibility, generally, included three types of activities: 1) education and culture change; 2) the delivery of psychosocial and medical services; and 3) hospital guidance document development. Finally, most AMC services existed within a fragile financial environment with idiosyncratic arrangements.

Conclusions
As OUD-related hospitalizations increase stakeholders look to innovative care delivery mechanisms to improve care and outcomes for persons with OUD. The implementation of an AMC service may be an organizational intervention for achieving these aims. Understanding the shared and different approaches to AMC service structure and design is an important first step for delivery systems interested in implementing or expanding these services.},

	abstract = {Background Specialist drug treatment is critical to overdose prevention; methadone maintenance is effective, but we lack evidence for other modalities. We evaluate the impact of a range of treatments for opiate dependence on overdose mortality. Methods Prospective cohort study of 10 454 heroin users entering treatment 1998–2001 in Italy followed-up for 10 208 person-years in treatment and 2914 person-years out of treatment. Standardized overall mortality ratios (SMR) estimate excess mortality risk for heroin users in and out of treatment compared to the general population. Cox models compare the hazard ratio (HR) of overdose between heroin users in treatment and out of treatment. Results There were 41 overdose deaths, 10 during treatment and 31 out of treatment, generating annual mortality rates of 0.1\% and 1.1\% and SMRs of 3.9 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 2.8–5.4] and 21.4 (16.7–27.4), respectively. Retention in any treatment was protective against overdose mortality (HR 0.09 95\% CI 0.04–0.19) compared to the risk of mortality out of treatment, independent of treatment type and potential confounders. The risk of a fatal overdose was 2.3\% in the month immediately after treatment and 0.77\% in the subsequent period; compared to the risk of overdose during treatment the HR was 26.6 (95\% CI 11.6–61.1) in the month immediately following treatment and 7.3 (3.3–16.2) in the subsequent period. Conclusions We demonstrate that a range of treatments for heroin dependence reduces overdose mortality risk. However, the considerable excess mortality risk in the month following treatment indicates the need for greater health education of drug users and implementation of relapse and overdose death prevention programmes. Further investigation is needed to measure and weigh the potential benefits and harms of short-term therapies for opiate use.},

The Medicaid data set included the years 2001 through 2007. Death record information was obtained from the National Death Index. Data analysis occurred from October 2017 to January 2018.Crude mortality rates per 100 000 person-years were determined in the first year after nonfatal opioid overdose. Standardized mortality rate ratios (SMR) were estimated for all-cause and selected cause-specific mortality standardized to the general population with respect to age, sex, and race/ethnicity.The primary cohort included 76 325 adults and 66 736 person-years of follow-up. During the first year after nonfatal opioid overdose, there were 5194 deaths, the crude death rate was 778.3 per 10 000 person-years, and the all-cause SMR was 24.2 (95\% CI, 23.6-24.9). The most common immediate causes of death were substance use–associated diseases (26.2\%), diseases of the circulatory system (13.2\%), and cancer (10.3\%). For every cause examined, SMRs were significantly elevated, especially with respect to drug use–associated diseases (SMR, 132.1; 95\% CI, 125.6-140.0), HIV (SMR, 45.9; 95\% CI, 39.5-53.0), chronic respiratory diseases (SMR, 41.1; 95\% CI, 36.0-46.8), viral hepatitis (SMR, 30.6; 95\% CI, 22.9-40.2), and suicide (SMR, 25.9; 95\% CI, 22.6-29.6), particularly including suicide among females (SMR, 47.9; 95\% CI, 39.8-52.3).In a US national cohort of adults who had experienced a nonfatal opioid overdose, a marked excess of deaths was attributable to a wide range of substance use–associated, mental health, and medical conditions, underscoring the importance of closely coordinating the substance use, mental health, and medical care of this patient population.},

The authors examined the association of psychiatric and substance use diagnoses with death from accidental overdose.Method:The study followed a cohort of patients from 2000 to 2006. The cohort included all patients treated in Veterans Health Administration facilities during fiscal year 1999 who were alive at the start of fiscal year 2000 (N=3,291,891). Death by accidental overdose was determined using National Death Index records and defined as a death with underlying cause of death coded to ICD-10 codes X40–X45 (N=4,485). Diagnoses were determined by patient medical records.Results:Adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics, hazard ratios of death by accidental overdose associated with prior psychiatric and substance use disorder diagnoses ranged from 1.8 to 8.8. Significant associations of non-substance-related psychiatric disorders with risk of death by accidental overdose persisted after additional adjustment for substance use disorders (hazard ratios from 1.2 to 1.8). Depressive disorders and anxiety disorders other than posttraumatic stress disorder had stronger associations with risk of medication-related overdose death (hazard ratios, 3.02 and 3.07, respectively) than with risk of overdose death related to alcohol or illegal drugs (hazard ratios, 1.89 and 1.23, respectively).Conclusions:Among patients receiving care from the Veterans Health Administration, death from accidental overdose was found to be associated with psychiatric and substance use disorders.

The magnitude of this epidemic is startling: About 4\% of the adult US population misuses prescription opioids, and in 2015, more than 33,000 deaths were attributable to overdose with licit and illicit opioids.
